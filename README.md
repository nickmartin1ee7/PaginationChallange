## Challange Prompt

October Challenge!
Theme: CSV Paginated

Mission - Pagination
- Your mission is to parse the given csv file and display the result with pagination, otherwise my PC will crash. That means I should be able to go to the next page and back. I want 10 items displayed per page and I also want to know the total amount of items.

Extra Mission - Linqinator
- Your targets are the ones above 18 and with a salary more than $2000. Order them by their LastName and Then By FirstName so we know who is next.

INFO
- The BirthDate can be null.
- You can either manually parse the CSV file with the help of Linq or use something like CsvHelper https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/
